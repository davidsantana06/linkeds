# LinkeDS

This project introduces a versatile implementation of linked data structures, encompassing stacks, queues, and linked lists. The structures are designed for 
adaptability, available in both bounded and dynamic size variations. Single and doubly linked nodes facilitate flexible element connections.

Incorporating advanced features, the project includes a Jsonifier class, which acts as an Abstract Base Class (ABC) for JSON serialization and deserialization. 
This comprehensive toolkit empowers developers with efficient and flexible linked data structures, suitable for diverse programming needs.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project has been developed based on Python 3.6 or above.
